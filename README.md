## OSINTials Toolkit
The OSINTials Toolkit is a toolkit comprised of various open-source intelligence tools focusing on OSINT for people. It is currently used during missing persons investigations and focuses on quality over quantity.

## Masterlists
The Masterlists section is where various OSINT toolkits and resources can be found. If you're looking for a particular toolkit or want to expand your own, this is the place to do it.

## Learn
Many people interested in open-source intelligence are unsure where to begin, the amount of resources and knowledge can be overwhelming. Because of this I have created a section of resources specifically designed to help get you started developing your OSINT skillset. You can find tools, methodology, and other educational walk-throughs here.

## Walk-Throughs
Walk-throughs are technique specific guides that explain various OSINT methods in-depth. If you're interested in learning various techniques, in addition to the dedicated learning section, give it look.

## Practice
Once you've started researching and developing your OSINT skillset you'll want to refine it. The Practice section was created with this in mind. Here you'll find a list of resources and challenges for you to practice your OSINT skillset.

## Bookmarks
Bookmarks are available as an easy way to import The-Kitchen-Sink resources.
